# Online Car Rental Platform

## Problem Statement
A car rental company wants an online platform where customers can view available cars, rent them on an hourly, daily, or weekly basis, and receive an auto-generated bill. The system should manage inventory, rental timing, and billing using Object-Oriented Programming concepts in Python.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python, Jupyter Notebook
- DateTime module
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts (classes, methods, objects)

## Project Steps
1. Created CarRental module with classes and methods for rentals.
2. Implemented hourly, daily, weekly rental logic.
3. Managed rental time and auto-generated billing.
4. Created Customer class to request and return cars.
5. Built a main project file with menu-driven system.
6. Tested the project and validated outputs.

## Output
- Screenshots and description included in `Online Car Rental Platform â€“ Python Project.pdf`.

## Key Learnings
- Applied OOP concepts: classes, objects, methods, encapsulation.
- Used Python modules and DateTime handling.
- Developed menu-driven interactive project workflow.
