# Ecommerce Online Shopping App

## Problem Statement
Develop a backend Python application simulating an e-commerce platform with user and admin roles. Users can log in, browse products, manage shopping carts, and simulate payments. Admins can manage product catalog and categories. The system should implement session-based functionality and role-based access control without a database or UI.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x
- PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods)
- Dictionary-based in-memory database simulation

## Project Features

### User Features
- Secure login with demo credentials
- View product catalog and categories
- Add, remove, and view items in cart
- Checkout with simulated payment options (UPI, Debit Card, etc.)
- Session-based cart management

### Admin Features
- Secure login with admin credentials
- Add, update, delete products
- Add or delete categories dynamically
- Access control ensures role separation

### Session Handling
- Unique session ID for each login
- Prevents invalid or unauthorized access

## Key Learnings
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  
- Dictionary-based data handling  
- Role-based access control and session management  
- Error handling and code reusability
