Build a Python-based backend for an e-commerce application with user and admin roles, shopping cart management, product catalog, and simulated payments.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python 3.x
- PyCharm / Jupyter Notebook
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, objects, methods)
- Dictionary-based in-memory database simulation

## Project Features

### User Features
- Secure login with demo credentials
- View product catalog and categories
